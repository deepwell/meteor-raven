Raven
============

Raven/Sentry integration for Meteor. Includes raven-js for frontend logging and raven for backend logging.

Provides consolidated error logging to Raven/Sentry from both the client and the server.

Usage
============
Configure your client and server DSN keys and log an error message.
<pre>
RavenLogger.initialize({
  client: 'your client DSN here',
  server: 'your server DSN here'
});
RavenLogger.log('Testing error message');
</pre>

Optionally you can pass a tag:
<pre>
RavenLogger.log('Testing error message', { component: 'system' });
</pre>

If you are using the Meteor Accounts package, you can enable user tracking on errors:
<pre>
RavenLogger.initialize({
  client: 'your client DSN here',
  server: 'your server DSN here'
}, {
  trackUser: true
});
</pre>

Raven also works very well with saving full error and exception stack traces. Simply pass an Error or a Meteor.Error object to the log method to keep the stack trace.
<pre>
RavenLogger.log(new Meteor.Error(422, 'Failed to save object to database'));
</pre>

Catching uncaught exceptions on the server:
<pre>
RavenLogger.initialize({
  client: 'your client DSN here',
  server: 'your server DSN here'
}, {
  patchGlobal: true
});
</pre>

You can also provide a callback to `patchGlobal`:
<pre>
RavenLogger.initialize({
  client: 'your client DSN here',
  server: 'your server DSN here'
}, {
  patchGlobal: function() {
    console.log('Bye, bye, world');
    process.exit(1);
  }
});
</pre>

If no callback is provided, the default behaviour is to `exit(1)`.
